This Code applies to all project spaces and activities, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Documentation and design artifacts
- Community communication channels linked to this project
- Private communications related to project work

---

## ‚úÖ Our Standards

We strive to create a positive environment where all people feel welcome. Examples of expected behavior include:

- Being respectful, considerate, and constructive
- Welcoming differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what‚Äôs best for the community and project
- Sharing context and reproducible steps when reporting issues

---

## üö´ Unacceptable Behavior

Behavior that undermines a safe and inclusive environment is not tolerated, including:

- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments
- Personal attacks, insults, or demeaning language
- Trolling, deliberate disruption, or thread derailment
- Publishing others‚Äô private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct that is unlawful or otherwise inappropriate in a professional setting

---

## üß∞ Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code.

---

## üì£ Reporting a Concern

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- If safe, raise the concern in the relevant thread to de‚Äëescalate and refocus.
- Otherwise, report privately using one of the following:
  - Open a GitHub issue with the `code-of-conduct` label (omit sensitive details if necessary), or
  - Contact the repository owner/maintainers via email or direct message through their GitHub profiles.

Please include:

- A description of the behavior
- Links, screenshots, or other context
- Where and when it happened, and any prior attempts to resolve it

We will handle reports promptly, confidentially, and with care.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement & Consequences

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to:

- Warning the reported individual(s)
- Removing or editing content
- Temporary or permanent bans from any project space
- Escalation to platform or organizational authorities when required

Enforcement will be fair, consistent, and proportional to the behavior and context.

---

## üì® Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error or was disproportionate, you may request a review by contacting the maintainers with relevant context. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not directly involved with the original action whenever possible.

---

## üßæ Attribution

This Code is inspired by common open‚Äësource community guidelines (including the Contributor Covenant) and adapted for this project. Suggestions to improve it are welcome via pull request.
