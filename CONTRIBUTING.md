## Documentation Conventions (Style Guide)

Please follow these rules for all Markdown docs under `docs/`:

- Quick summary at the top (no “Executive Summary”), followed by 3 bullets:
  - What’s inside, Best for, Outcomes
- Scores and claims:
  - Overall CAF/WAF compliance: 94/100
  - WAF Security pillar: 96/100
  - Do not state 96/100 as the overall score
- Diagrams and fences:
  - Mermaid blocks use triple backticks with `mermaid`
  - Use `\n` inside Mermaid labels instead of `<br/>`
  - Keep diagrams minimal and readable
- Punctuation & tone:
  - Use ASCII punctuation (quotes, dashes, ellipses)
  - Clear, concise, action‑oriented prose
- Links & references:
  - Prefer relative links (`./file.md`, `../folder/file.md`)
  - Validate links resolve; remove or fix dead links
  - Avoid linking to deleted stubs

Before opening a PR, skim related guides for consistent wording and anchors. Small inconsistencies are welcome fixes.
