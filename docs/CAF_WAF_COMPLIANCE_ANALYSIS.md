## 🎯 **Priority Recommendations**

### 🔥 **High Priority (Immediate)**

#### 1. **Implement Managed Identities**
```bicep
// Add to all Azure resources
resource containerApp 'Microsoft.App/containerApps@2022-10-01' = {
  name: containerAppName
  location: location
  identity: {
    type: 'SystemAssigned'
  }
  properties: {
    // ... existing properties
  }
}

// Key Vault access policy for managed identity
resource keyVaultAccessPolicy 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/accessPolicies@2023-02-01' = {
  name: 'add'
  parent: keyVault
  properties: {
    accessPolicies: [
      {
        objectId: containerApp.identity.principalId
        tenantId: subscription().tenantId
        permissions: {
          secrets: ['get']
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2. **Add Security Hardening**
```bicep
// SQL Server security configuration
resource sqlServer 'Microsoft.Sql/servers@2022-11-01-preview' = {
  name: sqlServerName
  location: location
  properties: {
    administratorLogin: sqlAdminUsername
    administratorLoginPassword: sqlAdminPassword
    minimalTlsVersion: '1.2'
    publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'
  }
  
  // Add firewall rules
  resource firewallRules 'firewallRules@2022-11-01-preview' = {
    name: 'AllowAzureServices'
    properties: {
      startIpAddress: '0.0.0.0'
      endIpAddress: '0.0.0.0'
    }
  }
}

// Storage account security
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-01-01' = {
  name: storageAccountName
  location: location
  properties: {
    minimumTlsVersion: 'TLS1_2'
    supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true
    allowBlobPublicAccess: false
    networkAcls: {
      defaultAction: 'Deny'
      bypass: 'AzureServices'
    }
  }
}
```

### 🔶 **Medium Priority (Next Sprint)**

#### 3. **Implement Backup Strategies**
```bicep
// SQL Database backup configuration
resource sqlDatabase 'Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases@2022-11-01-preview' = {
  parent: sqlServer
  name: sqlDbName
  properties: {
    // ... existing properties
    backupStorageRedundancy: 'GeoZone'
  }
  
  // Long-term retention policy
  resource longTermRetentionPolicy 'backupLongTermRetentionPolicies@2022-11-01-preview' = {
    name: 'default'
    properties: {
      weeklyRetention: 'P12W'
      monthlyRetention: 'P12M'
      yearlyRetention: 'P5Y'
      weekOfYear: 1
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. **Add Cost Optimization Features**
```bicep
// Storage lifecycle management
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-01-01' = {
  name: storageAccountName
  location: location
  properties: {
    // ... existing properties
  }
  
  resource lifecyclePolicy 'managementPolicies@2023-01-01' = {
    name: 'default'
    properties: {
      policy: {
        rules: [
          {
            name: 'DeleteOldBlobs'
            enabled: true
            type: 'Lifecycle'
            definition: {
              filters: {
                blobTypes: ['blockBlob']
              }
              actions: {
                baseBlob: {
                  tierToCool: {
                    daysAfterModificationGreaterThan: 30
                  }
                  tierToArchive: {
                    daysAfterModificationGreaterThan: 90
                  }
                  delete: {
                    daysAfterModificationGreaterThan: 365
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 🔵 **Low Priority (Future Enhancements)**

#### 5. **Policy as Code Implementation**
```bicep
// Azure Policy for resource compliance
resource resourceNamingPolicy 'Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions@2021-06-01' = {
  name: 'stamps-naming-convention'
  properties: {
  displayName: 'Azure Stamps Pattern Naming Convention'
    policyType: 'Custom'
    mode: 'All'
    policyRule: {
      if: {
        field: 'type'
        equals: 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts'
      }
      then: {
        effect: 'deny'
        condition: {
          not: {
            field: 'name'
            like: 'st[a-z][a-z][a-z]*'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 6. **Enhanced Monitoring Dashboards**
```bicep
// Application Insights dashboard
resource dashboard 'Microsoft.Portal/dashboards@2020-09-01-preview' = {
  name: 'stamps-pattern-dashboard'
  location: location
  properties: {
    lenses: {
      '0': {
        order: 0
        parts: {
          '0': {
            position: {
              x: 0
              y: 0
              colSpan: 6
              rowSpan: 4
            }
            metadata: {
              inputs: [
                {
                  name: 'resourceTypeMode'
                  isOptional: true
                }
              ]
              type: 'Extension/HubsExtension/PartType/MonitorChartPart'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Why Availability Zones Matter in the Azure Stamps Pattern**
- **High Availability (HA):** Deploying CELLs across multiple AZs protects against datacenter failures and supports strict SLA targets.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR):** AZs enable rapid failover and business continuity for each CELL.
- **Flexible Cost/SLA:** You can choose the number of AZs per CELL to balance cost and durability for each tenant or workload, supporting both enterprise and cost-sensitive scenarios.
