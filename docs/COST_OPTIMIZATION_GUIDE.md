# üí∞ Azure Stamps Pattern - Cost Optimization Guide

> **Purpose:** This guide helps architects, DevOps, and IT leaders make informed decisions about cost management and optimization when deploying and operating the Azure Stamps Pattern.

---

## üéØ Overview

Cost optimization in the Azure Stamps Pattern is about balancing performance, reliability, and compliance with efficient resource usage. This guide covers:
- Cost-saving strategies for each architectural layer
- Azure-native tools for monitoring and controlling spend
- Tips for right-sizing, scaling, and automation
- Real-world examples and best practices

## üèóÔ∏è Cost Optimization by Layer

### 1. **Global Layer**
- **Azure Front Door/Traffic Manager**: Use standard SKUs unless advanced features are required.
- **DNS Zones**: Consolidate DNS zones where possible.
- **Global Cosmos DB**: Use multi-region writes only if required; otherwise, prefer single-region for cost savings.

### 2. **Regional Layer**
- **App Gateway**: Use auto-scaling and WAF policies to avoid over-provisioning.
- **Key Vault**: Use standard tier unless HSM-backed keys are required.
- **Log Analytics**: Set retention policies and use basic logs for non-critical data.

### 3. **CELL Layer**
- **Container Apps**: Enable scale-to-zero for dev/test environments.
- **SQL/Cosmos DB**: Use serverless or auto-scale tiers for unpredictable workloads.
- **Storage**: Apply lifecycle management to move blobs to cool/archive tiers.
- **Redis**: Use basic or standard tiers for non-critical caching.

## ‚ö° General Cost-Saving Strategies

- **Right-Size Resources**: Start small and scale up as needed.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Use Azure autoscale for compute and databases.
- **Dev/Test vs. Prod**: Use lower-cost SKUs for non-production environments.
- **Resource Tagging**: Tag resources by environment, owner, and project for cost tracking.
- **Budgets & Alerts**: Set up Azure Cost Management budgets and alerts.
- **Reservation & Savings Plans**: Use reserved instances for predictable workloads.
- **Delete Unused Resources**: Regularly audit and remove orphaned resources.

## üìä Monitoring & Reporting

- **Azure Cost Management + Billing**: Analyze spend, forecast, and set budgets.
- **Log Analytics**: Track resource utilization and identify underused assets.
- **Application Insights**: Monitor app performance to avoid over-provisioning.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Build dashboards for per-CELL, per-region, and per-service cost visibility.
