## üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Terms**

### **Azure Stamps Pattern**
An Azure architectural pattern that deploys identical "stamps" of infrastructure globally for scalability and isolation.
- **Analogy**: Like franchise restaurants - each location (stamp) has the same setup but serves different customers (tenants)
- **Benefits**: Predictable performance, easier troubleshooting, horizontal scaling
- **Example**: Netflix uses a similar pattern to serve different regions with identical infrastructure


### **GEO ‚Üí Region ‚Üí Availability Zone ‚Üí CELL Hierarchy**
The four-tier architecture structure of the Azure Stamps Pattern:
- **GEO**: Geographic area (e.g., North America, Europe) - highest level routing
- **Region**: Azure region within a GEO (e.g., East US, West Europe) - regional services
- **Availability Zone (AZ)**: Physically separate datacenters within a region, providing high availability and fault tolerance. Each CELL can be deployed in 0, 1, 2, or 3 zones depending on business and SLA requirements.
- **CELL**: Individual application instance within a zone - tenant hosting and logical isolation

**Visual Representation:**
```
üåç North America GEO
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üè¢ East US Region
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÇÔ∏è AZ 1
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üè† CELL-001 (Shared: 50 tenants)
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üè† CELL-002 (Dedicated: 1 enterprise tenant)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÇÔ∏è AZ 2
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üè† CELL-003 (Shared: 30 tenants)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üè¢ West US Region
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÇÔ∏è AZ 1
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üè† CELL-004 (Shared: 75 tenants)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üóÇÔ∏è AZ 2
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üè† CELL-005 (Dedicated: 1 enterprise tenant)
```

**Why Availability Zones Matter:**
- **High Availability (HA):** Deploying CELLs across multiple AZs protects against datacenter failures.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR):** AZs enable rapid failover and business continuity.
- **Flexible Cost/SLA:** You can choose the number of AZs per CELL to balance cost and durability for each tenant or workload.


### **CELL (Compute Environment for Logical Isolation)**
An isolated application instance that hosts one or more tenants.
- **Shared CELL**: Multi-tenant, cost-optimized (10-100 tenants per CELL)
- **Dedicated CELL**: Single-tenant, compliance-focused (1 tenant per CELL)
- **Analogy**: Shared CELL = apartment building; Dedicated CELL = private house

---

## üè† **Tenancy Models**

### **Multi-Tenancy**
Architecture where multiple customers (tenants) share the same application instance and infrastructure.
- **Benefits**: Cost efficiency, easier maintenance, resource optimization
- **Challenges**: Isolation, customization, performance consistency

### **Flexible Tenancy**
The ability to support different tenancy models within the same architecture.
- **Business Value**: Mix and match based on customer needs and budget
- **Example**: SMB customers ‚Üí Shared CELLs; Enterprise customers ‚Üí Dedicated CELLs

### **Tenant**
A customer or organization using your SaaS application.
- **Examples**: A company, department, or user group
- **Isolation**: Each tenant's data and configuration are separated from others

### **Tenant Assignment**
The process of determining which CELL will host a specific tenant.
- **Factors**: Compliance requirements, performance needs, cost considerations
- **Automation**: Intelligent algorithms can auto-assign based on predefined rules

---

## üîí **Security Terms**

### **Zero-Trust Security**
Security model that assumes no implicit trust - everything must be verified.
- **Principles**: "Never trust, always verify"
- **Implementation**: Private endpoints, managed identities, continuous verification
- **Analogy**: Like airport security - everyone gets checked, regardless of who they are

### **Private Endpoints**
Azure feature that provides secure connectivity to services over a private network.
- **Benefit**: Eliminates exposure to public internet
- **Example**: Database only accessible via private network, not public IP

### **Managed Identity**
Azure feature that provides applications with an automatically managed identity in Azure AD.
- **Benefit**: No need to store credentials in code
- **Types**: System-assigned (tied to resource) or User-assigned (shared across resources)

### **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
A secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object.
- **Use Case**: Authentication and authorization
- **Performance**: Enhanced with caching (85-90% improvement in this implementation)

---

## ‚ö° **Performance & Scaling Terms**

### **Caching**
Storing frequently accessed data in fast storage for quick retrieval.
- **Types**: Redis (distributed), In-memory (local)
- **Benefit**: Reduces database load and improves response times
- **Monitoring**: Cache hit ratio should be >80%

### **Auto-Scaling**
Automatic adjustment of resources based on demand.
- **Horizontal**: Add more instances (scale out)
- **Vertical**: Increase instance size (scale up)
- **Triggers**: CPU usage, memory usage, request count

### **Load Balancing**
Distributing incoming requests across multiple servers.
- **Benefits**: High availability, better performance, fault tolerance
- **Implementation**: Azure Application Gateway, Azure Load Balancer

## üõ†Ô∏è **Infrastructure & DevOps Terms**

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
Managing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files.
- **Tools**: Bicep, ARM Templates, Terraform
- **Benefits**: Version control, repeatability, consistency

### **Bicep**
Azure's domain-specific language for deploying Azure resources.
- **Advantage**: Simpler than ARM templates, compiles to JSON
- **Example**: Declarative syntax for defining Azure resources

### **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
Automated practices for building, testing, and deploying code.
- **CI**: Automatically test code changes
- **CD**: Automatically deploy tested changes
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
