### 🏗️ **Architecture Components**

```
🌐 Management Portal Architecture
├── 🖥️  Blazor Server Portal (ASP.NET Core 9)
│   ├── TenantOnboarding.razor (Multi-step wizard)
│   ├── CellManagement.razor (Advanced analytics)
│   └── Dashboard (Real-time metrics)
├── 🔌 Data API Builder (GraphQL/REST)
│   ├── Role-based security

    ├── operations (audit trail)
    └── catalogs (configuration data)
```

### 🎯 **Intelligent Features**

#### **Smart Cell Assignment Algorithm**

```csharp
// Enterprise tier - dedicated resources
if (tier == "enterprise")
    → Find dedicated cell with optimal isolation

// SMB tier - premium shared with balanced utilization  
if (tier == "smb")
    → Find cell with 30-70% utilization (good neighbors)

// Startup tier - cost-optimized shared
if (tier == "startup") 
    → Find cell with lowest utilization (best value)
```

#### **Auto-Scaling Logic**

- **Proactive scaling**: Deploy new cells before reaching capacity
- **Regional distribution**: Balance load across availability zones
- **Tier-aware scaling**: Different thresholds for different tenant tiers

### 🚀 **Next Steps Available**
