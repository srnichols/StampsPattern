# Sample Galleries Index

This page links to screenshot galleries for sample apps and the management portal to make them easier to discover.

## Galleries

- Management Portal
  - `management-portal/docs/SCREENSHOTS.md` — screenshots and thumbnails for the Management Portal sample app.
  - Link: [Management Portal screenshots](management-portal/docs/SCREENSHOTS.md)

- TaskTracker Sample
  - `samples/tasktracker/docs/SCREENSHOTS.md` — screenshots and thumbnails for the TaskTracker sample app.
  - Link: [TaskTracker screenshots](samples/tasktracker/docs/SCREENSHOTS.md)


## How to add a gallery

1. Create a `docs/SCREENSHOTS.md` in your sample folder.
2. Add images to the same folder and (optionally) a `thumbnails/` subfolder.
3. If you want automated thumbnails, add or reuse `.github/workflows/generate-thumbnails.yml` and the helper script `management-portal/docs/generate-thumbnails.ps1`.
