# Plan to Resolve DAB GraphQL Query Failures

## Overview
This plan addresses the issue of GraphQL queries failing to retrieve data from Cosmos DB via Data API Builder (DAB) in the management-portal project. It breaks down the diagnosis and resolution into actionable steps.

## Todo List
- [ ] Verify DAB container health and logs for crash loops or startup errors using Azure CLI commands.
- [ ] Compare GraphQL schema (schema.graphql) with Cosmos DB container structures for mismatches.
- [ ] Test sample GraphQL queries directly against DAB endpoint to reproduce retrieval failures.
- [ ] Analyze error handling in GraphQLDataService.cs and add logging for detailed failure insights.
- [ ] Review Bicep deployment (management-portal.bicep) for configuration issues like ports or secrets.
- [ ] Implement fixes, such as updating schema or deployment settings, and redeploy.
- [ ] Validate end-to-end data retrieval in the portal UI after fixes.

## Next Steps
Once approved, switch to debug mode to execute these steps.
