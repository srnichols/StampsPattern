# 🌍 Azure Stamps Pattern - Enterprise CAF/WAF Compliant Architecture (96/100 Score)

> **Enterprise-ready, zero-trust, and cost-optimized Azure SaaS architecture for regulated industries and high-scale multi-tenancy.**


> **Cloud Capacity Management & Supply Constraints**
>
> All major cloud providers occasionally face regional or zone capacity limits for compute and storage due to demand surges, supply chain issues, or quota exhaustion. The Stamps Pattern’s modular, zone-aware, and multi-region CELL design gives you more options to mitigate these challenges: if a region or AZ is at capacity, you can deploy new CELLs in available locations with minimal disruption, maintaining business continuity and agility even in constrained environments.

This repository provides a production-grade, CAF/WAF-compliant Azure reference implementation for organizations seeking secure, scalable, and automated SaaS solutions. Designed for both IT leaders and developers, it enables rapid onboarding, compliance, and operational excellence.

## 💡 Why This Project?

**What makes this implementation unique?**
- 🛡️ Enhanced Zero-Trust Security: Network micro-segmentation with private endpoints and managed identities
- 📜 Automated Governance: Azure Policy as Code ensuring 100% compliance enforcement
- 🤖 AI-Driven Operations: Intelligent monitoring, predictive scaling, and cost optimization
- 🔐 Advanced Security: Customer-managed encryption, private endpoints, enhanced JWT validation
- 📊 Operational Excellence: Real-time insights with comprehensive dashboards and alerting
- ⚡ High Performance: Intelligent caching and query optimization for enterprise scale

**Why choose this for enterprise SaaS?**
The pattern solves critical enterprise challenges with flexible tenancy models while maintaining the highest security and compliance standards. You can optimize costs with shared CELLs for smaller clients ($8-16/tenant/month) while providing dedicated CELLs for enterprise customers requiring compliance, custom configurations, or performance guarantees ($3,200/tenant/month).

This pattern is particularly powerful for regulated industries (healthcare, financial services, government) where dedicated isolation and comprehensive compliance aren't just preferred—they're mandatory for regulatory adherence.

## 🌱 **Scaling & Management**

### ➕ **Adding New Tenants - Flexible Models**

#### **🏠 Shared CELL Onboarding** (Cost-Effective)
```bash
# 1. Check shared CELL capacity (recommended: 10-100 tenants max)
az monitor metrics list \
  --resource rg-stamps-shared-cell-1 \
  --metric "CPUUtilization" "MemoryUtilization"

# 2. Add tenant to existing shared CELL (if capacity available)
# Update Global Cosmos DB routing table
# No new infrastructure deployment needed

# 3. Configure application-level tenant isolation
# Database schema creation
# Storage container provisioning
```

#### **🏢 Dedicated CELL Deployment** (Enterprise-Grade)
```bash
# 1. Deploy dedicated infrastructure for enterprise client
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group rg-stamps-production \
  --template-file traffic-routing.bicep \
  --parameters @traffic-routing.parameters.json \
  --parameters tenantType=dedicated tenantName=enterprise-banking

# 2. Configure dedicated monitoring and compliance
# 3. Verify dedicated CELL health
az containerapp list --resource-group rg-stamps-eus-production \
  --query "[?contains(name, 'enterprise-banking')].{Name:name, Status:properties.provisioningState}"
```

#### **🔄 Tenant Migration Path**
```bash
# Growing tenant: Shared → Dedicated migration
# 1. Deploy new dedicated CELL
# 2. Migrate tenant data (zero-downtime)  
# 3. Update Global Cosmos DB routing
# 4. Validate migration and performance
```

### 🌍 **Geographic Expansion**
```bash
# 1. Add new GEO to parameters
{
  "geoName": "AsiaPacific",
  "regions": [
    {
      "regionName": "southeastasia",
      "cells": ["tenant-fintech", "tenant-ecommerce"]
    }
  ]
}

# 2. Deploy with updated configuration
# 3. Update DNS for new geography
# 4. Configure Traffic Manager with new endpoints
```

### 📊 **Performance Optimization**
- **Container Apps**: Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory/custom metrics
- **SQL Database**: Elastic pools for cost optimization
- **Storage**: Hot/Cool/Archive tiers with lifecycle policies
- **CDN**: Intelligent caching with custom rules

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### ✅ **Pre-Deployment Testing**
```bash
# Bicep template validation
bicep build traffic-routing.bicep
bicep build AzureArchitecture/main.bicep

# What-if analysis
az deployment group what-if \
  --resource-group rg-stamps-eus-dev \
  --template-file traffic-routing.bicep \
  --parameters @traffic-routing.parameters.json

# Security validation
az security assessment list \
  --query "[?status.code=='Unhealthy']"
```

### 🔍 **Post-Deployment Validation**
```bash
# Health check script
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Performance testing
./scripts/load-test.sh

# Security scanning
./scripts/security-scan.sh
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### ❓ **Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Resource Naming Conflicts** | Deployment fails with naming error | Update `resourcePrefix` parameter |
| **API Management Timeout** | Deployment hangs at APIM | Premium APIM takes 45-60 minutes - be patient |
| **APIM Multi-Region Setup** | Additional regions not deploying | Ensure Premium SKU and check regional quotas |
| **SQL Password Complexity** | SQL deployment fails | Ensure password meets complexity requirements |
| **Region Service Availability** | Service not available error | Check service availability in target region |
| **Certificate Issues** | SSL/TLS errors | Verify Key Vault certificate configuration |
| **APIM Policy Validation** | API calls rejected | Check tenant-specific policies and rate limits |

### 🔧 **Diagnostic Commands**
```bash
# Check resource health
az resource list --resource-group rg-stamps-production \
  --query "[?provisioningState!='Succeeded']"

# Test endpoints
curl -I https://stamps-tm-global.trafficmanager.net
curl -I https://stamps-fd-global.azurefd.net

# View deployment logs
az deployment group show \
  --resource-group rg-stamps-production \
